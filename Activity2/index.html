                    <h1>Petra,Jordan</h1>
                    <p>We had been to a lot of ancient cities before we made our way to Petra. We thought we had seen it
                        all until we walked through the 1.2km long siq (a narrow gorge with high rock walls reaching 80
                        meters into the air) leading to the incredible Treasury building. The journey was beautiful but
                        once we arrived at the opening in the middle of a canyon, we gasped in awe. This ancient wonder
                        was hidden from the outside world for centuries. It wasn’t until 1812 that it was “discovered”
                        by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Since then the Lost City has become Jordan’s premier
                        tourist attraction.</p>

                    <p>We have had the privilege of visiting The Great Wall of China, not once, but twice! We have been
                        to
                        two sections the Muytianyu Wall and the Badaling Great Wall. Both were equally impressive. We
                        really
                        feel that the Great Wall of China lives up to the hype. The location is breathtaking as it
                        weaves
                        through the mountains and spans for miles and miles. Even with the crowds of Badaling which is
                        closes to Beijing, we loved it. The wall was built the 7th century and spanned nearly 9000 km.

                    <p>Rio De Janeiro is one of our favourite cities on earth. Christ the Redeemer stands proud overhead
                        high on a mountain overlooking the city and can be seen from all vantage points. The most
                        amazing experience we had was doing a doors-off helicopter ride to view Christ the Redeemer from
                        above. The statue of Jesus perched on Mount Corcovado began construction in 1926. Standing 30
                        meters tall it is a massive achievement and has contributed to making Rio one of the most
                        popular tourist destinations on the planet.</p>

                    <p>It was always our dream to see the Colosseum of Italy. When we finally made it to Rome, we not
                        only had the chance to see it, we stayed in the most incredible apartment right beside this
                        wonder with a view of the ruins from our window. Built in the 1st century, this amphitheater has
                        a bloody past with Gladiators fighting to the death and Christians being thrown to the lions.
                        Animals were used and abused here and it is thought that half a million people and nearly one
                        million animals died within its walls. Today, it stands in ruins and no longer sees bloodshed.
                        Instead, it sees many tourists with more than 6 million people visiting it each year!</p>

                    <h1>Machu Pichu, Peru</h1>
                    <p>When we first arrived at Machu Picchu in Peru it was shrouded in clouds. I’ll never forget the
                        look on Dave’s face. He was dejected. It was our one and only time visiting this wonder of the
                        world and we weren’t going to see it! Luckily, as the morning progressed, the heavens opened up
                        and we witnessed the awe-inspiring sight of this ancient city high in the Andes mountains.
                        Discovered by the western world in 1911, the Incan City is believed to have been inhabited in
                        the 1600s. Machu Picchu deserves to be on this list with its impressive location. Located at an
                        altitude of 2400 meters, the city’s terraces plunge into the valley below. How they built these
                        structures on the side of a mountain hundreds of years ago is beyond my comprehension but to see
                        it today will blow you away.</p>

                    <h1>Chichen Itza, Mexico</h1>
                    <p>Chichen Itza was the first of the new wonders of the world that Dave and I ever visited. In fact,
                        our trip to Mexico in 1999 was one of the first international trips we ever took together. I’ll
                        never forget a friend telling us to go and I am glad we listened. Back then you could still walk
                        up the ancient pyramid and it was harrowing. We understood why they closed it to tourists, it
                        was steep and scary but it was also an experience we’ll never forget. The Mayan City of Chichén
                        Itzá is located in the Yucatan Peninsula and dates back to the 9th century. It is closely tied
                        to astronomy with buildings precisely made to coincide with the Spring and winter equinox. The
                        Great Pyramid also has 365 steps and a platform dedicated to Venus.</p>

                    <p>The Taj Mahal in India was our least favorite of all the new seven wonders to visit but it is
                        still impressive to see. We actually never wrote about our time there as we didn’t love Agra or
                        the Taj. Obviously many people disagree with us as it was named one of the seven. The Taj Mahal
                        is considered one of the finest examples of Mughal Architecture. It is also considered to be a
                        beautiful love story as it was completed in 1658 by Emperor Shah Jahn who built it for his wife.
                        She died in 1631, just three years after he began construction but he continued on to honor her
                        memory.</p>
